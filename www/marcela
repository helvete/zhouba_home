	What actually makes me feel like livin is talking to you, being with you, feeling you. I need to see you more. Marcela, You, the love of my life. I want to be here for you and I want you to be here for me. Is it too much to ask? Perhaps so, yet both you and me deserve to be happy, do we not? I love you!
